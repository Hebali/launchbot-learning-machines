## [Learning Machines](http://www.patrickhebron.com/learning-machines)
**Taught by [Patrick Hebron](http://patrickhebron.com) at [ITP](http://itp.nyu.edu), Fall 2016**

This repo contains a dockerfile to get you up and running with TensorFlow, Jupyter Notebooks and a few related tools. This repo also contains several example Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate various machine learning tools in TensorFlow. 

For the Learning Machines class, we will be using Andrew Odewahn's [LaunchBot](http://launchbot.io).

Please see the [LaunchBot Getting Started Tutorial](http://launchbot.io/docs/tutorial/getting-started) for instructions on how to install Docker and LaunchBot.

The example notebooks included in this repo have been pulled or adapted from the collections listed below. Please investigate the links below as you develop your project ideas for the class. I particularly recommend taking a closer look at the example projects in [Aymeric Damien's TensorFlow-Examples](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples).
